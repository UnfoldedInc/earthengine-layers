    "In contrast to the `EarthEngineLayer`, where you need to supply _one_ Earth Engine object to render, with the `EarthEngineTerrainLayer` you must supply **two** Earth Engine objects. The first is used to render the image in the same way as the `EarthEngineLayer`; the second supplies elevation values used to extrude terrain in 3D. Hence the former can be any `Image` object; the latter must be an `Image` object whose values represents terrain heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important for the terrain source to have relatively high spatial resolution. In previous examples, we used [SRTM90][srtm90] as an elevation source, but that only has a resolution of 90 meters. When used as an elevation source, it looks very blocky/pixelated at high zoom levels. In this example we'll use [SRTM30][srtm30] (30-meter resolution) as the `Image` source and the [USGS's National Elevation Dataset][ned] (10-meter resolution, U.S. only) as the terrain source. SRTM30 is generally the best-resolution worldwide data source available.\n",
