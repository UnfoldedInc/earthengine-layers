# Authentication

Authenticating with Earth Engine services is likely to be the biggest complication for developers who are not already working with the EE API.

While the EE API documenation and forums are the official source of information on how to authenticate, this is a quick overview 

## Authenticating via Login (Oauth)

Note that this requires:
- registering a Google client id
- requesting Earth Engine access for that client
- adding the URLs from which the application will be served to the whitelisted origins for that client id.

## Authenticating via a Token

TBA
