# pydeck Integration

> This page is WIP. More information will be added soon.

The `EarthEngineLayer` can be imported into [`pydeck`](https://pydeck.gl) as a custom layer module.

## Usage

### Authentication

Supplying EE authentication token from Python to the `EarthEngineLayer` (TBA)

### Serialization

EarthEngine API objects need to be serialized before they are passed to the `EarthEngineLayer`.
